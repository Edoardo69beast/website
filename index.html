	The financial crisis of 2007-2008, or Global Financial Crisis (GFC), was a severe worldwide economic crisis that occurred in the early 21st century. 
	It was the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression (1929). Predatory lending targeting low-income homebuyers, 
	excessive risk-taking by global financial institutions, and the bursting of the United States housing bubble culminated in a "perfect storm". 
	Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) tied to American real estate, as well as a vast web of derivatives linked to those MBS, collapsed in value. 
	Financial institutions worldwide suffered severe damage, reaching a climax with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008, and a 
	subsequent international banking crisis.
